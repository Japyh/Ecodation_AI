    ">\n",
    "> There were small robots in the mechanical clocks that Al Jazari gave detailed drawings of in the book he wrote in the early 1200s. These mechanical robots could move their hands and arms and play music.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Legends and later mechanical robots show that humans have always wanted to build machines with artificial intelligence.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In 1637, French mathematician and philosopher Rene Descartes said that a machine that could think like a human would never be built.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The first work recognized as artificial intelligence today is McCulloch and Pitts' Turing-Complete design of artificial neural cells in 1943.\n",

Thanks to the Lisp programming language, voice recognition technology was developed and the personal assistant application of the Iphone was created (today).\n",
